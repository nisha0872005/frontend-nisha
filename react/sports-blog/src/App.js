      <h4>
        The injured Dallas Cowboys defensive back made it clear watching Monday Night Football last night: his brother, Stefon, needs to get out of Buffalo ASAP!
      </h4>

      <p>
        There is some MAJOR drama in Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. 
        Last night, QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks. 
        This time to the often self-destructive Denver Broncos.

      <h3>Stefon Diggs, especially, has been frustrated.</h3>
      <p>
        The elite wideout has been seen vocalizing his frustrations with the coaching staff and his QB on the sideline during games over the last season and a half.
      </p>

      <h2>Is this Stefon's last year with the Bills?</h2>
      <p>
        Rumblings on social media suggest that we could see a split between Stefon Diggs and the Buffalo Bills similar to the one we saw with the Minnesota Vikings a few years ago.
